# employee_file_processor
This is a project related to increase skills on using java file operations.

**Task**

3 - Write a Java program to create a class named "EmployeeFileProcessor" with the following specifications:

- The class should include a method named "processEmployeeFile" that reads employee information from a text file named "employee_data.txt" located in the same directory as the Java program.
- Each line in the file represents an employee's information in the following format: "ID Name Salary".
- The method should parse each line, create Employee objects with the read data, and print the details of each employee to the console.
- Implement a simple Employee class with private attributes for employee ID (an integer), employee name (a string), and employee salary (a double). You don't need to include methods for this class.
- Ensure that your program handles file IO exceptions gracefully.
- Write a main method to demonstrate the functionality of the EmployeeFileProcessor class by calling the "processEmployeeFile" method.

Your task:

- Implement the EmployeeFileProcessor class as described above.
- Implement the main method to create an instance of the EmployeeFileProcessor class and call the "processEmployeeFile" method.
- Test your program with different employee data in the "employee_data.txt" file and verify that the employee details are read and printed correctly.

This question focuses specifically on file handling in Java and requires you to demonstrate your ability to read data from a file, parse it, and process it accordingly.
